ETFs own financial assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies, debts, futures contracts, and/or commodities such as gold bars. Many ETFs provide some level of diversification compared to owning an individual stock.\\n\\n\\n== Details ==\\nAn ETF divides ownership of itself into shares that are held by shareholders. Depending on the country, the legal structure of an ETF can be a corporation, trust, open-end management investment company, or unit investment trust. Shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund and are entitled to a share of the profits, such as interest or dividends, and would be entitled to any residual value if the fund undergoes liquidation. They also receive annual reports. An ETF generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value, although deviations can occur.\\nThe largest ETFs, which passively track stock market indices, have annual expense ratios as low as 0.03% of the amount invested, although specialty ETFs can have annual fees of 1% or more of the amount invested. These fees are paid to the ETF issuer out of dividends received from the underlying holdings or from the sale of assets.\\nIn the United States, there is $5.4 trillion invested in equity ETFs and $1.4 trillion invested in fixed-income ETFs. In Europe, there is $1.0 trillion invested in equity ETFs and $0.4 trillion invested in fixed-income ETFs. In Asia, there is $0.9 trillion invested in equity ETFs and $0.1 trillion invested in fixed-income ETFs. In the first quarter of 2023, trading in ETFs accounted for 32% of the total dollar volume of stock market trading in the US, 11% of trading volume in Europe, and 13% of trading volume in Asia.\\nIn the US, the largest ETF issuers are BlackRock iShares with a 34% market share, Vanguard with a 29% market share, State Street Global Advisors with a 14% market share, Invesco with a 5% market share, and Charles Schwab with a 4% market share.\\nETFs are regulated by governmental bodies (such as the SEC and the CFTC in the United States) and are subject to securities laws (such as the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States).\\nClosed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs; even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange they do not change the number of shares they have issued, unlike an ETF. Exchange-traded notes are debt instruments that are not exchange-traded funds.\\n\\n\\n== ETFs vs. mutual funds ==\\nETFs are similar in many ways to mutual funds, except that ETFs are bought and sold from other owners throughout the day on stock exchanges, whereas mutual funds are bought and sold from the issuer based on their price at day\\'s end. ETFs are also more transparent since their holdings are generally published online daily and, in the United States, are more tax efficient than mutual funds. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs trade on a stock exchange, can be sold short, can be purchased using funds borrowed from a stockbroker (margin), and can be purchased and sold using limit orders, with the buyer or seller aware of the price per share in advance.\\n\\n\\n=== Costs and fees ===\\nBoth ETFs and mutual funds charge annual expense ratios that range from 0.02% of the investment value to upwards of 1% of the investment value. Mutual funds generally have higher annual fees since they have higher marketing, distribution and accounting expenses (12b-1 fees). ETFs are also generally cheaper to operate since, unlike mutual funds, they do not have to buy and sell securities and maintain cash reserves to accommodate shareholder purchases and redemptions.\\nStockbrokers may charge different commissions, if any, for the purchase and sale of ETFs and mutual funds.

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT\">\\nChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It uses GPT-5, a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model.\\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. As of May 2025, ChatGPT\\'s website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally. The chatbot is recognized for its versatility and articulate responses. Its capabilities include answering follow-up questions, writing and debugging computer programs, translating, and summarizing text. Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts. Since its initial launch, OpenAI has integrated additional features, including plugins, web browsing capabilities, and image generation. It has been lauded as a revolutionary tool that could transform numerous professional fields. At the same time, its release prompted extensive media coverage and public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.\\nDespite its acclaim, the chatbot has been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use. It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data may be reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy. These issues have led to its use being restricted in some workplaces and educational institutions and have prompted widespread calls for the regulation of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== Training ==\\n\\nChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been fine-tuned for conversational assistance. The fine-tuning process involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses generated by the model in previous conversations. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\", that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\\nTime magazine reported that, to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning around $1.32 to $2 per hour to label such content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI\\'s outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to further train and fine-tune its services. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback.\\nChatGPT\\'s training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, multiple programming languages, and the text of Wikipedia.\\n\\n\\n== Features ==\\n\\nChatGPT is a conversational chatbot and artificial intelligence assistant based on large language models. It can write and debug computer programs; compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker); generate business ideas; translate and summarize text; simulate a Linux system; simulate entire chat rooms; or play ga\\n</Document>',\n",

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)\">\\nQuantitative analysis is the use of mathematical and statistical methods in finance and investment management. Those working in the field are quantitative analysts (quants). Quants tend to specialize in specific areas which may include derivative structuring or pricing, risk management, investment management and other related finance occupations. The occupation is similar to those in industrial mathematics in other industries. The process usually consists of searching vast databases for patterns, such as correlations among liquid assets or price-movement patterns (trend following or reversion).\\nAlthough the original quantitative analysts were \"sell side quants\" from market maker firms, concerned with derivatives pricing and risk management, the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of mathematical finance, including the buy side. Applied quantitative analysis is commonly associated with quantitative investment management which includes a variety of methods such as statistical arbitrage, algorithmic trading and electronic trading.\\nSome of the larger investment managers using quantitative analysis include Renaissance Technologies, D. E. Shaw & Co., and AQR Capital Management.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nQuantitative finance started in 1900 with Louis Bachelier\\'s doctoral thesis \"Theory of Speculation\", which provided a model to price options under a normal distribution. \\nJules Regnault had posited already in 1863 that stock prices can be modelled as a random walk, suggesting \"in a more literary form, the conceptual setting for the application of probability to stockmarket operations\".\\nIt was, however, only in the years 1960-1970 that the \"merit of [these] was recognized\" \\n\\nas options pricing theory was developed. \\nHarry Markowitz\\'s 1952 doctoral thesis \"Portfolio Selection\" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to specialized economics journals). Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of \"diversification\" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold  only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return. \\nThus, although the language of finance now involves Itô calculus, management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.\\nModern quantitative investment management was first introduced from the research of Edward Thorp, a mathematics professor at New Mexico State University (1961–1965) and University of California, Irvine (1965–1977). Considered the \"Father of Quantitative Investing\", Thorp sought to predict and simulate blackjack, a card-game he played in Las Vegas casinos. He was able to create a system, known broadly as card counting, which used probability theory and statistical analysis to successfully win blackjack games. His research was subsequently used during the 1980s and 1990s by investment management firms seeking to generate systematic and consistent returns in the U.S. stock market.\\nThe field has grown to incorporate numerous approaches and techniques; see Outline of finance § Quantitative investing, Post-modern portfolio theory, Financial economics  § Portfolio theory.\\nIn 1965, Paul Samuelson introduced stochastic calculus into the study of finance. In 1969, Robert Merton promoted continuous stochastic calculus and continuous-time processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of \"equilibrium\", and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue. At the same time as Merton\\'s work and with Merton\\'s assistance, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes developed the Black–Sc\\n</Document>',\n",
       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis\">\\nIn finance, technical analysis is an analysis methodology for analysing and forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. As a type of active management, it stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of technical analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results. It is distinguished from fundamental analysis, which considers a company\\'s financial statements, health, and the overall state of the market and economy.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe principles of technical analysis are derived from hundreds of years of financial market data. Some aspects of technical analysis began to appear in Amsterdam-based merchant Joseph de la Vega\\'s accounts of the Dutch financial markets in the 17th century. In Asia, technical analysis is said to be a method developed by Homma Munehisa during the early 18th century which evolved into the use of candlestick techniques, and is today a technical analysis charting tool.\\nJournalist Charles Dow (1851–1902) compiled and closely analyzed American stock market data, and published some of his conclusions in editorials for The Wall Street Journal. He believed patterns and business cycles could possibly be found in this data, a concept later known as \"Dow theory\". However, Dow himself never advocated using his ideas as a stock trading strategy.\\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Richard W. Schabacker published several books which continued the work of Charles Dow and William Peter Hamilton in their books Stock Market Theory and Practice and Technical Market Analysis. In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published Technical Analysis of Stock Trends which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of point and figure chart analysis.  With the emergence of behavioral finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioral finance and coined the term \"Behavioral Technical Analysis\".\\nOther pioneers of analysis techniques include Ralph Nelson Elliott, William Delbert Gann, and Richard Wyckoff who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century.\\n\\n\\n== General description ==\\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratios, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and market trends in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.\\nTechnicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known head and shoulders or double top/bottom reversal patterns, study technical indicators, moving averages and look for forms such as lines of support, resistance, channels and more obscure formations such as flags, pennants, balance days and cup and handle patterns.\\nTechnical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the moving average, relative strength index and MACD. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options (implied volatility) and put/call rat\\n</Document>',\n",

IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 19 research facilities across a dozen countries; for 29 consecutive years, from 1993 to 2021, it held the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business.\\nIBM was founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. During the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360 and its successors, was the world\\'s dominant computing platform, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide. Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large.\\nIBM debuted in the microcomputer market in 1981 with the IBM Personal Computer, — its DOS software provided by Microsoft, which became the basis for the majority of personal computers to the present day. The company later also found success in the portable space with the ThinkPad. Since the 1990s, IBM has concentrated on computer services, software, supercomputers, and scientific research; it sold its microcomputer division to Lenovo in 2005. IBM continues to develop mainframes, and its supercomputers have consistently ranked among the most powerful in the world in the 21st century. In 2018, IBM along with 91 additional Fortune 500 companies had \"paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less\" as a result of Donald Trump\\'s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\\nAs one of the world\\'s oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several technological innovations, including the Automated Teller Machine (ATM), Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM), the floppy disk, Generalized Markup Language, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, and the Universal Product Code (UPC) barcode. The company has made inroads in advanced computer chips, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data infrastructure. IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including six Nobel Prizes and six Turing Awards. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1910s–1950s ===\\nIBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late 19th century. Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine (1889); and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record workers\\' arrival and departure times on a paper tape (1889). On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Canada.\\nCollectively, the companies manufactured a wide array of machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards.

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_governance\">\\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) is shorthand for an investing principle that prioritizes environmental issues, social issues, and corporate governance. Investing with ESG considerations is sometimes referred to as responsible investing or, in more proactive cases, impact investing.\\nThe term ESG first came to prominence in a 2004 report titled \"Who Cares Wins\", which was a joint initiative of financial institutions at the invitation of the United Nations (UN).  By 2023, the ESG movement had grown from a UN corporate social responsibility initiative into a global phenomenon representing more than US$30 trillion in assets under management. \\nCriticisms of ESG vary depending on viewpoint and area of focus. These areas include data quality and a lack of standardization; evolving regulation and politics; greenwashing; and variety in the definition and assessment of social good. Some critics argue that ESG serves as a de facto extension of governmental regulation, with large investment firms like BlackRock imposing ESG standards that governments cannot or do not directly legislate. This has led to accusations that ESG creates a mechanism for influencing markets and corporate behavior without democratic oversight, raising concerns about accountability and overreach.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nInvestment decisions are predominantly based on the potential for financial returns for a given level of risk. However, there have always been many other criteria for deciding where to place money—from political considerations to heavenly reward.\\nIn the 1970s, the worldwide abhorrence of the apartheid regime in South Africa led to one of the most renowned examples of selective disinvestment along ethical lines. As a response to a growing call for sanctions against the regime, the Reverend Leon Sullivan, a board member of General Motors in the United States, drew up a Code of Conduct in 1977 for practising business with South Africa. What became known as the Sullivan Principles (Sullivan Code) attracted a great deal of attention. Several reports were commissioned by the government to examine how many US companies were investing in South African businesses that were contravening the Sullivan Code. The conclusions of the reports led to mass disinvestment by the US from many South African companies. The resulting pressure applied to the South African regime by its business community added great weight to the growing impetus for the system of apartheid to be abandoned.\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the economist Milton Friedman, in response to the prevailing mood of philanthropy, argued that social responsibility adversely affects a firm\\'s financial performance and that regulation and interference from \"big government\" will always damage the macro economy. His contention that the valuation of a company or asset should be predicated almost exclusively on the financial bottom line (with the costs incurred by social responsibility being deemed non-essential) was prevalent for most of the 20th century (see Friedman doctrine). Towards the end of the 20th century, however, a contrary theory began to gain ground. In 1988 James S. Coleman wrote an article in the American Journal of Sociology titled \"Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital\", the article challenged the dominance of the concept of \\'self-interest\\' in economics and introduced the concept of social capital into the measurement of value.\\nThere was a new form of pressure applied, acting in a coalition with environmental groups: using the leveraging power of collective investors to encourage companies and capital markets to incorporate environmental and social risks and opportunities into their decision-making.\\nAlthough the concept of selective investment was not a new one, with the demand side of the investment market having a long history of those wishing to control the effects of their investments, what began to develop at the turn of the 21st century was a response from the supply-side of the eq\\n</Document>',\n",

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_Integrated_Environmental_and_Economic_Accounting\">\\nSystem of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a framework to compile statistics linking environmental statistics to economic statistics. SEEA is described as a satellite system to the United Nations\\'s System of National Accounts (SNA). This means that the definitions, guidelines and practical approaches of the SNA are applied to the SEEA. This system enables environmental statistics to be compared to economic statistics as the system boundaries are the same after some processing of the input statistics. By analysing statistics on the economy and the environment  at the same time it is possible to show different patterns of sustainability for production and consumption. It can also show the economic consequences of maintaining a certain environmental standard.\\n\\n\\n== Scope ==\\nThe SEEA is a satellite system of the SNA that consists of several sets of accounts. In broad terms, the area can be described as enabling any user of statistics to compare environmental issues to general economics, knowing that the comparisons are based on the same entities, for example, pollution levels caused by a producing industry can be linked to the specific economics of that industry.\\nThe different areas of SEEA can be briefly described as follows:\\n\\n\\n=== Flows of materials and energy ===\\nBy this is meant flows of materials and energy through the economy, e.g., fuels, natural resources and chemicals, together with their emissions, may it be air emissions, water pollution or waste to which these flows give rise. Data on emissions, above all to the air, have been published for many countries, in particular, European countries following SEEA. The main difference between traditional emissions statistics and emissions in environmental accounts are related to the system boundaries. For example, the inventories produced for the reporting of air emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are based on the geographic borders of a country while the air emission accounts following SEEA use the boundary of a specific economy (this is the \"residence principle\" of the national accounts). This difference is mainly shown in transport emissions as all emissions caused by an economy are included in SEEA. For example, emissions from trucks, ships or airplanes are allocated to their country of origin, even if the emissions occur outside of the borders of this country. Moreover, in the UNFCCC inventories, \"transport\" is a specific sector of its own and it is not possible to know the share of households and of different industries in the transport emissions.\\nOther statistics that have been developed with relation to flows of material are economy-wide material flow accounts and still being developed are energy flow- and \\nwater flow accounts.\\n\\n\\n=== Environmental economic statistics ===\\nEconomic variables that are already included in the national accounts but are of obvious environmental interest, such as investments and expenditure in the area of environmental protection, environment-related taxes and subsidies, and environmental classification of activities and the employment associated with them, etc. In principle, environmental taxes and environmental protection expenditures can be regarded as two sides of the same coin. Both entail costs involved in production processes that are related to the exploitation of the environment in different ways. On the one hand, environmental protection expenditures record spending on measures aimed at improving the environment, while on the other hand, taxes record the costs set by a government for the exploitation of the environment. Thus, in the total cost of production, the environmental taxes paid can be added to expenditure on environmental protection.\\n\\n\\n=== Stocks of natural resources ===\\nNatural resources in the sense that the accounts should make it possible to describe stocks and changes in stocks of selected finite or renewable resources.

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_planning\">\\nScenario planning, scenario thinking, scenario analysis, scenario prediction and the scenario method all describe a strategic planning method that some organizations use to make flexible long-term plans. It is in large part an adaptation and generalization of classic methods used by military intelligence.\\nIn the most common application of the method, analysts generate simulation games for policy makers. The method combines known facts, such as demographics, geography and mineral reserves, with military, political, and industrial information, and key driving forces identified by considering social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (\"STEEP\") trends.\\nIn business applications, the emphasis on understanding the behavior of opponents has been reduced while more attention is now paid to changes in the natural environment. At Royal Dutch Shell for example, scenario planning has been described as changing mindsets about the exogenous part of the world prior to formulating specific strategies.\\nScenario planning may involve aspects of systems thinking, specifically the recognition that many factors may combine in complex ways to create sometimes surprising futures (due to non-linear feedback loops). The method also allows the inclusion of factors that are difficult to formalize, such as novel insights about the future, deep shifts in values, and unprecedented regulations or inventions. Systems thinking used in conjunction with scenario planning leads to plausible scenario storylines because the causal relationship between factors can be demonstrated. These cases, in which scenario planning is integrated with a systems thinking approach to scenario development, are sometimes referred to as \"dynamic scenarios\".\\nCritics of using a subjective and heuristic methodology to deal with uncertainty and complexity argue that the technique has not been examined rigorously, nor influenced sufficiently by scientific evidence. They caution against using such methods to \"predict\" based on what can be described as arbitrary themes and \"forecasting techniques\".\\nA challenge and a strength of scenario-building is that \"predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process\". As a consequence, societal predictions can become self-destructing. For example, a scenario in which a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more secure cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.\\n\\n\\n== Principle ==\\n\\n\\n=== Crafting scenarios ===\\nCombinations and permutations of fact and related social changes are called \"scenarios\". Scenarios usually include plausible, but unexpectedly important, situations and problems that exist in some nascent form in the present day. Any particular scenario is unlikely. However, futures studies analysts select scenario features so they are both possible and uncomfortable. Scenario planning helps policy-makers and firms anticipate change, prepare responses, and create more robust strategies.\\nScenario planning helps a firm anticipate the impact of different scenarios and identify weaknesses. When anticipated years in advance, those weaknesses can be avoided or their impacts reduced more effectively than when similar real-life problems are considered under the duress of an emergency. For example, a company may discover that it needs to change contractual terms to protect against a new class of risks, or collect cash reserves to purchase anticipated technologies or equipment. Flexible business continuity plans with \"PREsponse protocols\" can help cope with similar operational problems and deliver measurable future value.\\n\\n\\n=== Wargam\\n</Document>']}"

The study of logic and formal reasoning from antiquity to the present led directly to the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired scientists to begin discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College in 1956. Attendees of the workshop became the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would exist within a generation. The U.S. government provided millions of dollars with the hope of making this vision come true.\\nEventually, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of this feat. In 1974, criticism from James Lighthill and pressure from the U.S.A. Congress led the U.S. and British Governments to stop funding undirected research into artificial intelligence. Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government and the success of expert systems  reinvigorated investment in AI, and by the late 1980s, the industry had grown into a billion-dollar enterprise. However, investors\\' enthusiasm waned in the 1990s, and the field was criticized in the press and avoided by industry (a period known as an \"AI winter\"). Nevertheless, research and funding continued to grow under other names.\\nIn the early 2000s, machine learning was applied to a wide range of problems in academia and industry. The success was due to the availability of powerful computer hardware, the collection of immense data sets, and the application of solid mathematical methods. Soon after, deep learning proved to be a breakthrough technology, eclipsing all other methods. The transformer architecture debuted in 2017 and was used to produce impressive generative AI applications, amongst other use cases.\\nInvestment in AI boomed in the 2020s. The recent AI boom, initiated by the development of transformer architecture, led to the rapid scaling and public releases of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models exhibit human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity, and have been integrated into various sectors, fueling exponential investment in AI. However, concerns about the potential risks and ethical implications of advanced AI have also emerged, causing debate about the future of AI and its impact on society.\\n\\n\\n== Precursors ==\\n\\n\\n=== Mythical, fictional, and speculative precursors ===\\n\\n\\n==== Myth and legend ====\\nIn Greek mythology, Talos was a creature made of bronze who acted as guardian for the island of Crete.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Within the field of Artificial Intelligence, there are multiple subfields. The subfield of Machine learning has been used for various scientific and commercial purposes including language translation, image recognition, decision-making, credit scoring, and e-commerce. In recent years, there have been massive advancements in the field of Generative Artificial Intelligence, which uses generative models to produce text, images, videos or other forms of data. This article describes applications of AI in different sectors. \\n\\n\\n== Agriculture ==\\n\\nIn agriculture, AI has been proposed as a way for farmers to identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatments to increase yields, thereby improving efficiency. AI has been used to attempt to classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and optimize irrigation.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture and design ==\\nAI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.\\nAI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.\\n\\n\\n== Business ==\\n\\n\\n=== Content extraction ===\\nAn optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Computer science ==\\n\\n\\n=== Programming assistance ===\\n\\n\\n==== AI-powered code assisting tools ====\\nAI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy. Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilot is one example. It was developed by GitHub and OpenAI and is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.\\n\\n\\n==== Neural network design ====\\nAI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google\\'s AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet\\'s performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n==== Quantum computing ====\\n\\nMachine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology, including quantum sensors. Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications, and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications.

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)\">\\nQuantitative analysis is the use of mathematical and statistical methods in finance and investment management. Those working in the field are quantitative analysts (quants). Quants tend to specialize in specific areas which may include derivative structuring or pricing, risk management, investment management and other related finance occupations. The occupation is similar to those in industrial mathematics in other industries. The process usually consists of searching vast databases for patterns, such as correlations among liquid assets or price-movement patterns (trend following or reversion).\\nAlthough the original quantitative analysts were \"sell side quants\" from market maker firms, concerned with derivatives pricing and risk management, the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of mathematical finance, including the buy side. Applied quantitative analysis is commonly associated with quantitative investment management which includes a variety of methods such as statistical arbitrage, algorithmic trading and electronic trading.\\nSome of the larger investment managers using quantitative analysis include Renaissance Technologies, D. E. Shaw & Co., and AQR Capital Management.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nQuantitative finance started in 1900 with Louis Bachelier\\'s doctoral thesis \"Theory of Speculation\", which provided a model to price options under a normal distribution. \\nJules Regnault had posited already in 1863 that stock prices can be modelled as a random walk, suggesting \"in a more literary form, the conceptual setting for the application of probability to stockmarket operations\".\\nIt was, however, only in the years 1960-1970 that the \"merit of [these] was recognized\" \\n\\nas options pricing theory was developed. \\nHarry Markowitz\\'s 1952 doctoral thesis \"Portfolio Selection\" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to specialized economics journals). Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of \"diversification\" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold  only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return. \\nThus, although the language of finance now involves Itô calculus, management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.\\nModern quantitative investment management was first introduced from the research of Edward Thorp, a mathematics professor at New Mexico State University (1961–1965) and University of California, Irvine (1965–1977). Considered the \"Father of Quantitative Investing\", Thorp sought to predict and simulate blackjack, a card-game he played in Las Vegas casinos. He was able to create a system, known broadly as card counting, which used probability theory and statistical analysis to successfully win blackjack games. His research was subsequently used during the 1980s and 1990s by investment management firms seeking to generate systematic and consistent returns in the U.S. stock market.\\nThe field has grown to incorporate numerous approaches and techniques; see Outline of finance § Quantitative investing, Post-modern portfolio theory, Financial economics  § Portfolio theory.\\nIn 1965, Paul Samuelson introduced stochastic calculus into the study of finance. In 1969, Robert Merton promoted continuous stochastic calculus and continuous-time processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of \"equilibrium\", and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue. At the same time as Merton\\'s work and with Merton\\'s assistance, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes developed the Black–Sc\\n</Document>',\n",
       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis\">\\nThe efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to \"beat the market\" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.\\nBecause the EMH is formulated in terms of risk adjustment, it only makes testable predictions when coupled with a particular model of risk. As a result, research in financial economics since at least the 1990s has focused on market anomalies, that is, deviations from specific models of risk.\\nThe idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to Bachelier, Mandelbrot, and Samuelson, but is closely associated with Eugene Fama, in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research.  The EMH provides the basic logic for modern risk-based theories of asset prices, and frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing can be thought of as the combination of a model of risk with the EMH.\\n\\n\\n== Theoretical background ==\\nSuppose that a piece of information about the value of a stock (say, about a future merger) is widely available to investors.  If the price of the stock does not already reflect that information, then investors can trade on it, thereby moving the price until the information is no longer useful for trading.\\nNote that this thought experiment does not necessarily imply that stock prices are unpredictable. For example, suppose that the piece of information in question says that a financial crisis is likely to come soon. Investors typically do not like to hold stocks during a financial crisis, and thus investors may sell stocks until the price drops enough so that the expected return compensates for this risk.\\nHow efficient markets are (and are not) linked to the random walk theory can be described through the fundamental theorem of asset pricing.  This theorem provides mathematical predictions regarding the price of a stock, assuming that there is no arbitrage, that is, assuming that there is no risk-free way to trade profitably.  Formally, if arbitrage is impossible, then the theorem predicts that the price of a stock is the discounted value of its future price and dividend:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          P\\n          \\n            t\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          E\\n          \\n            t\\n          \\n        \\n        [\\n        \\n          M\\n          \\n            t\\n            +\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        \\n          P\\n          \\n            t\\n            +\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        +\\n        \\n          D\\n          \\n            t\\n            +\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle P_{t}=E_{t}[M_{t+1}(P_{t+1}+D_{t+1})]}\\n  \\n\\nwhere \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          E\\n          \\n            t\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle E_{t}}\\n  \\n is the expected value given information at time \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        t\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle t}\\n  \\n,  \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          M\\n          \\n            t\\n            +\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle M_{t+1}}\\n  \\n is the stochastic discount factor, and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          D\\n          \\n            t\\n            +\\n            1\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle D_{t+1}}\\n  \\n is the dividend the stock pays next period.\\nNote that this equation does not generally imply a random walk.

The website uses graphs to compare the search volume of different queries over a certain period of time.\\nOn August 5, 2008, Google launched Google Insights for Search, a more sophisticated and advanced service displaying search trends data. On September 27, 2012, Google merged Google Insights for Search into Google Trends.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2000s ===\\nOriginally, Google neglected updating Google Trends on a regular basis. In March 2007, internet bloggers noticed that Google had not added new data since November 2006, and Trends was updated within a week. Google did not update Trends from March until July 30, and only after it was blogged about, again. Google now claims to be \"updating the information provided by Google Trends daily; Hot Trends is updated hourly.\" As of April 2025, data on the Google Trends website shows updates every minute, with a 4 minute delay, when the timeline parameter is set to “Past hour.”\\nOn August 6, 2008, Google launched a free service called Insights for Search. Insights for Search is an extension of Google Trends and although the tool is meant for marketers, it can be utilized by any user. The tool allows for the tracking of various words and phrases that are typed into Google\\'s search-box. The tracking device provided a more in-depth analysis of results. It also has the ability to categorize and organize the data, with special attention given to the breakdown of information by geographical areas. In 2012, Google Insights for Search was merged into Google Trends with a new interface.\\nGoogle Trends does not provide absolute values for the number of search queries, but instead shows relative search volumes (RSV). The relative search volumes are normalised to the highest value, which is set to 100. Seeing absolute search volumes requires a separate browser extension that overlays absolute numbers onto Google Trends’ y-axis. The popularity of up to 5 search terms or search topics can be compared directly. Additional comparisons require a comparison term or topic. In contrast to search terms, search topics are \"a group of terms that have the same concept in any language\".\\nIn 2009, Yossi Matias et al. published research on the predictability of search trends.\\n\\n\\n=== 2010s ===\\nIn a series of articles in The New York Times, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz used Google Trends to measure a variety of behaviors.  For example, in June 2012, he argued that search volume for the word \"nigger(s)\" could be used to measure racism in different parts of the United States.  Correlating this measure with Obama\\'s vote share, he calculated that Obama lost about 4 percentage points due to racial animus in the 2008 presidential election. He also used Google data, along with other sources, to estimate the size of the gay population.  This article noted that the most popular search beginning \"is my husband\" is \"is my husband gay?\" In addition, he found that American parents were more likely to search \"is my son gifted?\" than \"is my daughter gifted?\"  But they were more likely to search \"is my daughter overweight?\" than \"is my son overweight?\" He also examined cultural differences in attitudes around pregnancy.\\nGoogle Trends has also been used to forecast economic indicators, and financial markets, and analysis of Google Trends data has detected regional flu outbreaks before conventional monitoring systems. Google Trends is increasingly used in ecological and conservation studies, with the number of research articles growing over 50% per year.

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT\">\\nChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released on November 30, 2022. It uses GPT-5, a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period of rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model.\\nBy January 2023, ChatGPT had become the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. As of May 2025, ChatGPT\\'s website is among the 5 most-visited websites globally. The chatbot is recognized for its versatility and articulate responses. Its capabilities include answering follow-up questions, writing and debugging computer programs, translating, and summarizing text. Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts. Since its initial launch, OpenAI has integrated additional features, including plugins, web browsing capabilities, and image generation. It has been lauded as a revolutionary tool that could transform numerous professional fields. At the same time, its release prompted extensive media coverage and public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.\\nDespite its acclaim, the chatbot has been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use. It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data may be reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy. These issues have led to its use being restricted in some workplaces and educational institutions and have prompted widespread calls for the regulation of artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== Training ==\\n\\nChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been fine-tuned for conversational assistance. The fine-tuning process involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses generated by the model in previous conversations. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\", that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\\nTime magazine reported that, to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning around $1.32 to $2 per hour to label such content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI\\'s outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\\nOpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to further train and fine-tune its services.

       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis\">\\nThe American subprime mortgage crisis was a multinational financial crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010, contributing to the 2008 financial crisis. It led to a severe economic recession, with millions becoming unemployed and many businesses going bankrupt. The U.S. government intervened with a series of measures to stabilize the financial system, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).\\nThe collapse of the United States housing bubble and high interest rates led to unprecedented numbers of borrowers missing mortgage repayments and becoming delinquent. This ultimately led to mass foreclosures and the devaluation of housing-related securities. The housing bubble preceding the crisis was financed with mortgage-backed securities (MBSes) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which initially offered higher interest rates (i.e. better returns) than government securities, along with attractive risk ratings from rating agencies. Despite being highly rated, most of these financial instruments were made up of high-risk subprime mortgages.\\nWhile elements of the crisis first became more visible during 2007, several major financial institutions collapsed in late 2008, with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recession. Most notably, Lehman Brothers, a major mortgage lender, declared bankruptcy in September 2008. There were many causes of the crisis, with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions, regulators, credit agencies, government housing policies, and consumers, among others. Two proximate causes were the rise in subprime lending and the increase in housing speculation. Investors, even those with \"prime\", or low-risk, credit ratings, were much more likely to default than non-investors when prices fell. These changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higher-risk mortgage products, which contributed to U.S. households becoming increasingly indebted.\\nThe crisis had severe, long-lasting consequences for the U.S. and European economies. The U.S. entered a deep recession, with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009, roughly 6% of the workforce. The number of jobs did not return to the December 2007 pre-crisis peak until May 2014. U.S. household net worth declined by nearly $13 trillion (20%) from its Q2 2007 pre-crisis peak, recovering by Q4 2012. U.S. housing prices fell nearly 30% on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately 50% by early 2009, with stocks regaining their December 2007 level during September 2012. One estimate of lost output and income from the crisis comes to \"at least 40% of 2007 gross domestic product\". Europe also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis, with elevated unemployment and severe banking impairments estimated at €940 billion between 2008 and 2012. As of January 2018, U.S. bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration. A total of $626B was invested, loaned, or granted due to various bailout measures, while $390B had been returned to the Treasury. The Treasury had earned another $323B in interest on bailout loans, resulting in an $109B profit as of January 2021.\\n\\n\\n== Background and timeline of events ==\\n\\nThe immediate cause of the crisis was the bursting of the United States housing bubble which peaked in approximately 2006. An increase in loan incentives such as easy initial terms and a long-term trend of rising housing prices had encouraged borrowers to assume risky mortgages in the anticipation that they would be able to quickly refinance at easier terms. However, once interest rates began to rise and housing prices started to drop moderately in 2006–2007 in many parts of the U.S., borrowers were unable to refinance. Defaults and foreclosure activity increased dramatically as easy initial terms expired, home \\n</Document>',\n",

Debuting as a free website, it offered stock quotes, charts, news aggregation, and corporate data with an interactive interface. At launch, Google Finance entered a market dominated by Yahoo! Finance and MSN Money, which had established user bases of around 10 million monthly visitors. Analysts noted that while Google was “late to the party,” its strong track record with new services meant it could shake up the space. Early unique features included interactive stock charts with markers for news events, integration with Google News and Blogs, and the absence of advertising during its beta phase. By the end of 2006, Google rolled out a revamped homepage showcasing market trends (like top movers by sector based on Google Trends) and added features such as currency exchange rates and 40 years of historical stock data. In 2008, Google partnered with major exchanges to provide real-time prices for NASDAQ and NYSE stocks, eliminating the typical 15-minute quote delay. These improvements drove user growth and positioned Google Finance as a serious alternative to other free finance portals during its early years.\\n\\n\\n=== Stagnation and Portfolio Removal (2011–2017) ===\\nAfter the initial growth, feature development on Google Finance slowed. The service saw few major upgrades after 2008, and the official Google Finance Blog was quietly closed in 2012. By this period, many users perceived Google Finance’s interface as dated. Meanwhile, competitors like Yahoo Finance continued to update their platforms with modern designs and social features. Google’s lack of updates led to stagnation in its user base and functionality. A notable turning point came in late 2017: Google announced a significant overhaul of Google Finance, including the removal of the popular portfolios feature that allowed users to track custom lists of stocks. On September 22, 2017, Google confirmed the site was “under renovation” and that user portfolios would be discontinued by mid-November 2017. The decision, part of a plan to make the service appeal to a “wider audience,” prompted backlash from dedicated users who relied on the portfolio tracker. Google provided a tool for users to export their portfolio data, and in the interim directed them to a new “Your Stocks” feature integrated into Google Search. This integration marked a shift: Google Finance was increasingly tied into Google’s main search results (accessible via a “Finance” tab), rather than a standalone destination. By the end of 2017, Google Finance site had a refreshed look and feel, eliminating its reliance on Adobe Flash for charts (as all major browsers began blocking Flash). However, the removal of portfolios and the minimal feature improvements during this era contributed to a perception of decline in Google Finance’s competitiveness.\\n\\n\\n=== Redesign and Relaunch (2018–2020) ===\\nIn early 2018, Google Finance’s renovation went live, officially removing the old portfolio feature and migrating stock watchlists to the new interface. After a period of relative quiet, Google undertook a substantial redesign in 2020. In September 2020, Google Finance was relaunched with a new design and tools aimed at individual investors. The revamp introduced a more modern, card-based interface with bold colors and organized information, moving away from the look of a simple search results list. New features focused on simplicity and financial literacy: users could create Watchlists of stocks and quickly see relevant news, statistics, and earnings info for those companies. Google also integrated Google Calendar so investors could add earnings calls and corporate events with one click.

The company\\'s product lines include GeForce GPUs for gaming and creative workloads, and professional GPUs for edge computing, scientific research, and industrial applications. As of the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia held a 92% share of the discrete desktop and laptop GPU market.\\nIn the early 2000s, the company invested over a billion dollars to develop CUDA, a software platform and API that enabled GPUs to run massively parallel programs for a broad range of compute-intensive applications. As a result, as of 2025, Nvidia controlled more than 80% of the market for GPUs used in training and deploying AI models, and provided chips for over 75% of the world\\'s TOP500 supercomputers. The company has also expanded into gaming hardware and services, with products such as the Shield Portable, Shield Tablet, and Shield TV, and operates the GeForce Now cloud gaming service. It also developed the Tegra line of mobile processors for smartphones, tablets, and automotive infotainment systems. \\nIn 2023, Nvidia became the seventh U.S. company to reach a US$1 trillion valuation. In 2025, it became the first to surpass US$4 trillion in market capitalization, driven by rising global demand for data center hardware in the midst of the AI boom. For its strength, size and market capitalization, Nvidia has been selected to be one of Bloomberg\\'s \"Magnificent Seven\", the seven biggest companies on the stock market in these regards.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Founding ===\\n\\nNvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang (who remains CEO), a Taiwanese-American electrical engineer who was previously the director of CoreWare at LSI Logic and a microprocessor designer at AMD; Chris Malachowsky, an engineer who worked at Sun Microsystems; and Curtis Priem, who was previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at IBM and Sun Microsystems. In late 1992, the three men agreed to start the company in a meeting at a Denny\\'s roadside diner on Berryessa Road in East San Jose.\\nAt the time, Malachowsky and Priem were frustrated with Sun\\'s management and were looking to leave, but Huang was on \"firmer ground\", in that he was already running his own division at LSI. The three co-founders discussed a vision of the future which was so compelling that Huang decided to leave LSI and become the chief executive officer of their new startup.\\nThe three co-founders envisioned  graphics-based processing as the best trajectory for tackling challenges that had eluded general-purpose computing methods. As Huang later explained: \"We also observed that video games were simultaneously one of the most computationally challenging problems and would have incredibly high sales volume. Those two conditions don\\'t happen very often. Video games was our killer app — a flywheel to reach large markets funding huge R&D to solve massive computational problems.\"\\nThe first problem was who would quit first. Huang\\'s wife, Lori, did not want him to resign from LSI unless Malachowsky resigned from Sun at the same time, and Malachowsky\\'s wife, Melody, felt the same way about Huang. Priem broke that deadlock by resigning first from Sun, effective December 31, 1992. According to Priem, this put pressure on Huang and Malachowsky to not leave him to \"flail alone\", so they gave notice too.  Huang left LSI and \"officially joined Priem on February 17\", which was also Huang\\'s 30th birthday, while Malachowsky left Sun in earl\\n</Document>',\n",
       "  '<Document url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product\">\\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the total market value of all the final goods and services produced and rendered in a specific time period by a country or countries. GDP is often used to measure the economic activity of a country or region. The major components of GDP are consumption, government spending, net exports (exports minus imports), and investment. Changing any of these factors can increase the size of the economy. For example, population growth through mass immigration can raise consumption and demand for public services, thereby contributing to GDP growth. However, GDP is not a measure of overall standard of living or well-being, as it does not account for how income is distributed among the population. A country may rank high in GDP but still experience jobless growth depending on its planned economic structure and strategies. Dividing total GDP by the population gives a rough measure of GDP per capita. Several national and international economic organizations, such as the OECD and the International Monetary Fund, maintain their own definitions of GDP.\\nGDP is often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure of economic progress. It serves as a statistical indicator of national development and progress. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. Nominal GDP is useful when comparing national economies on the international market using current exchange rate. To compare economies over time inflation can be adjusted by comparing real instead of nominal values. For cross-country comparisons, GDP figures are often adjusted for differences in the cost of living using Purchasing power parity (PPP). GDP per capita at purchasing power parity can be useful for comparing living standards between nations. \\nGDP has been criticized for leaving out key externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work. Alternative economic indicators such as doughnut economics use other measures, such as the Human Development Index or Better Life Index, as better approaches to measuring the effect of the economy on human development and well being.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nSir William Petty came up with a concept of GDP, to calculate the tax burden, and argue landlords were unfairly taxed during warfare between the Dutch and the English between 1652 and 1674. Charles Davenant developed the method further in 1695.\\nThe modern concept of GDP was first developed by Simon Kuznets for a 1934 U.S. Congress report, where he warned against its use as a measure of welfare (see below under limitations and criticisms). After the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, GDP became the main tool for measuring a country\\'s economy. At that time gross national product (GNP) was the preferred estimate, which differed from GDP in that it measured production by a country\\'s citizens at home and abroad rather than its \"resident institutional units\" (see OECD definition above). The switch from GNP to GDP in the United States occurred in 1991. The role that measurements of GDP played in World War II was crucial to the subsequent political acceptance of GDP values as indicators of national development and progress. A crucial role was played here by the U.S. Department of Commerce under Milton Gilbert where ideas from Kuznets were embedded into institutions.\\nThe history of the concept of GDP should be distinguished from the history of changes in many ways of estimating it. The value added by firms is relatively easy to calculate from their accounts, but the value added by the public sector, by financial industries, and by intangible asset creation is more complex. These activities are increasingly important in developed economies, and the international conventions governing their estimation and their inclusion or exclusion in GDP regularly change in an attempt to keep up with industrial advances.
